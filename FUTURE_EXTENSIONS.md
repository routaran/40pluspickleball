## Business Logic Enhancements

### High Priority Database Constraints

#### 1. Event Capacity Enforcement
**Problem**: The `max_players` field exists but isn't enforced at the database level.
**Solution**: 
```sql
-- Trigger to enforce maximum player capacity
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_event_capacity()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    current_count INTEGER;
    max_allowed INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*), e.max_players 
    INTO current_count, max_allowed
    FROM event_players ep
    JOIN events e ON ep.event_id = e.id
    WHERE ep.event_id = NEW.event_id 
    AND ep.status = 'registered'
    GROUP BY e.max_players;
    
    IF max_allowed IS NOT NULL AND current_count >= max_allowed THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Event has reached maximum capacity';
    END IF;
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 2. Round Progression Enforcement
**Problem**: No database-level enforcement that all matches must be completed before advancing rounds.
**Solution**: 
- Add function to validate all matches in current round have scores
- Trigger on round status changes
- Prevent activation of next round until current is complete

#### 3. Match Status Transition Validation
**Problem**: Match status can be changed arbitrarily without following proper state machine.
**Solution**:
- Implement state transition validation (pending → in_progress → completed)
- Prevent backwards transitions
- Auto-update status when scores are entered

#### 4. Event Timing Validation
**Problem**: Scores can be entered before event has started.
**Solution**:
- Add temporal validation considering event date/time and timezone
- Prevent match scoring before event start time
- Consider buffer time for setup

### Medium Priority Enhancements

#### 5. Comprehensive Audit Trail
**Purpose**: Track all changes for accountability and debugging.
**Implementation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    table_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    record_id UUID NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    changed_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 6. Complete RLS Policies
**Missing Policies**:
- Users viewing/updating their own profiles
- Organizers creating new players
- Proper service role bypasses

### Low Priority Features

#### 7. Player Merge Functionality
**Purpose**: Handle duplicate player records.
**Features**:
- Merge statistics and history
- Update all foreign key references
- Maintain audit trail of merges

#### 8. Event Template System
**Purpose**: Speed up creation of recurring events.
**Implementation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_templates (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    template_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- courts, scoring, settings
    is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## ELO Rating System

### Overview
Implement a dynamic skill rating system based on the ELO algorithm, adapted for doubles pickleball play.

### Core Components

#### 1. Rating Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE player_ratings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
    rating INTEGER DEFAULT 1500,
    rating_deviation INTEGER DEFAULT 350, -- For confidence
    games_played INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_provisional BOOLEAN DEFAULT true, -- Until 20 games
    last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE rating_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    player_id UUID REFERENCES players(id),
    match_id UUID REFERENCES matches(id),
    rating_before INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rating_after INTEGER NOT NULL,
    rating_change INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS (rating_after - rating_before) STORED,
    opponent_avg_rating INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 2. Rating Calculation Algorithm
**Key Features**:
- K-factor adjustments: Higher for provisional players (K=40), lower for established (K=20)
- Team rating = average of partner ratings
- Win probability calculation based on rating difference
- Special handling for mismatched teams

**Formula Implementation**:
```javascript
function calculateELO(winnerRating, loserRating, kFactor = 20) {
    const expectedScore = 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, (loserRating - winnerRating) / 400));
    const winnerNewRating = winnerRating + kFactor * (1 - expectedScore);
    const loserNewRating = loserRating + kFactor * (0 - (1 - expectedScore));
    
    return {
        winnerChange: Math.round(winnerNewRating - winnerRating),
        loserChange: Math.round(loserNewRating - loserRating)
    };
}
```

#### 3. Integration Points
- **Match Generation**: Use ratings for balanced team creation
- **Event Organization**: Group players by rating bands
- **Progress Tracking**: Show rating trends over time
- **Leaderboards**: Overall and event-specific rankings

#### 4. Special Considerations
- **New Players**: Start with provisional rating of 1500
- **Inactive Players**: Rating decay or confidence reduction
- **Blowout Protection**: Cap maximum rating change per match
- **Partner Synergy**: Track performance with specific partners
