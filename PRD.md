# Product Requirements Document - 40+ Pickleball Website

## 1. Executive Summary
### 1.1 Product Overview
A web application designed to organize and manage single-day pickleball round robin tournaments for our local pickleball group. The system automatically generates match pairings using a rotation algorithm that ensures each player partners with different players throughout the event and faces new opponents in each game. The application tracks match results in real-time and generates standings tables to show player performance throughout the day.

### 1.2 Target Audience
- Primary: Our local pickleball group organizers who run weekly/regular round robin events
- Secondary: All participating players (various ages and skill levels) who want to view schedules and standings
- The system is designed for private use by our specific pickleball community

### 1.3 Key Objectives
- Automate the complex task of creating round robin match schedules that ensure fair rotation
- Eliminate scheduling conflicts where players might play with/against the same people multiple times
- Provide real-time score entry and automatic standings calculation
- Create a mobile-friendly interface that works courtside on phones/tablets
- Establish a foundation for future skill-based matchmaking capabilities
- Reduce the time organizers spend on manual scheduling from 30+ minutes to under 5 minutes
